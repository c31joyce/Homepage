						<p>This project has been a blast for me. In the beginning, I did not really have an idea of what project to work on. But since I was also interested in doing something related to music, it seemed plausible to head in that direction when finding others who also had the same interests.</p>
						<p>In terms of the basic overall experience, there was little difference in what I had already known about working on a team in a project of this scope. As Project Manager, I made sure that my team mates were on task during meetings and that none of the subsystem teams were doing things that would create conflict with the other subsystems. This required basic understanding of the entire system, as I would advise any Project Managers to take note of.</p>
						<p>In perspective, I am pretty proud of our team and what we have accomplished within this past half of a semester. Some of my advice for future PoE teams would be:
							<ul>
								<li>Assess your team members' strengths and weaknesses and act upon them accordingly. Make sure everyone on the team is happy with what they are doing and are displaying their technical expertises within the project. But also make sure each member challenges himself/herself. And most of all, have fun during meetings and while working on the project.</li>
								<li>Start with the big picture of what your project goals are and then go into the details of each subsystem. This will save your team a lot of time and arguments. Once the entire team understands what the major goals are and what are the major subsystems that need to be worked on, the details will naturally follow.</li>
								<li>Iterate early and iterate as much as you can. Don't be afraid to change things up, because it might just end up being the solution to your problem. Just be careful that all team members know what you're changing and how.</li>
							</ul>

						<p>Our team designed all of the components of our robotic violin as a group. Just because one or two team members had expertise in a subject didn’t mean that they designed that system by themselves. Everyone was involved. Everything was explained. Everyone contributed. Although this made the design processes more time-intensive, I feel that it was more than worth it. It led to my understanding every process - mechanical, electrical, and software. It also led to us having more innovative ideals. I would recommend this design process to any future POE teams.</p>

						<p>Another new aspect was this first projects was one of the first where I wasn’t the project manager. Usually, I send out team emails and meetings. Philicia, however, was designated PM and had everything firmly under control. With that said, just because I wasn’t the designated PM didn’t mean that I didn’t contribute to the project management. I learned that, when working on a sub-team, it is vitally important to let everyone know how the project is progressing. Additionally, even if one is not the project manager, it is very important to stop once and a while and ask everyone for their opinion. This is especially important when encountering a problem. As the adage goes, two heads are better than one. This should easily be extended to the fact that (when debugging) the team is better than a sub-team. I feel that I have had important contributions to the mechanical engineering. I also feel that my non-computing teammates contributed to software decisions.</p>

						<p>On a more pedantic note, I feel that I’ve learned a lot of electrical, mechanical, and software engineering. For example, I helped Kevin (our electrical lead) a lot in creating the electrical system. I’ve learned what an H-Bridge is and how to use it. I’m infinitely better in diagnosing an electrical system with a power supply and a multimeter. Since our team ideated the mechanical system as a group, I also learned a lot of mechanical engineering concepts. In particular, my understanding of gears - how to choose one and what are the available options - has really increased. Finally, even though I am a E:C, I still feel that I learned new computer software skills. We worked with a BeagleBone for a majority of the project; this was a new micro-controller in a language that I had never used before. Understanding how to work with this system as well as mastering the intricacies of asynchronous interrupt-driven development in Javascript really added to my computing repertoire. </p>

						<p>I believe that we had unrealistic “dream” goals for our project. The team wanted our robotic violin to sound just as good is a normal violin (which has been finely tuned by craftsmen since the 16th century). We wanted it to be able to play complex pieces (which takes human beings years, sometimes decades, to learn). We wanted to be able to control the violin from a web app (which was only possible with a Beagle Bone microprocessor or a complex Arduino shield). Each one of these in itself is a major stretch goal. To think that we could complete them all with a budget of $250 was unrealistic. With that said, I think have goals like these were a good thing. It got us excited about our project. These goals encouraged us do the best we possibly could. However, I have learned not to be too disappointed when some or all of the “dream” goals fail. It is important to occasionally stand back and be realistic. </p>

						<p>When realistic, I think that the outcome of our project was amazing. We chose a very hard project and elected to use previously unknown hardware and software. Not only did we learn how to use new technology (which will be helpful in the professional world) but we also succeeded in our primary goal. We effectively created a cheap robot that sounds like a violin and plays songs. </p>

						<p>	My advice for future POE teams are to reach for the stars because it will make your project better. But don’t be discouraged if you fall a little short. Just revel in what you did accomplish. In order to balance challenging yourself and selecting a project with the right scope, simply set realistic minimum and awesome reach goals while defining your project. I would also encourage teams to use a piece of technology that you haven’t used yet. It will make things more difficult, but you will learn a lot! As Les Brown, a famous American clarinet said, “Shoot for the moon because even if you miss, you’ll land among the stars.”</p>

						<p>I personally think that our robotic violin project is a very bright star. I couldn’t be more pleased. </p>

							In addition to the engineering expertise, I learned a few really useful things about similarly-scoped projects that I'd like to pass on to anyone who might attempt a similar project in the future.
							<ul>
								<li>
									First, prototype early and often.  It is far better to admit that you haven't yet thought of a mechanism for one specific part of the system and get a revision out with other parts that are thought of than delay while you wait to have something that is 'theoretically' perfect.
								</li>
								<li>
									Second, be very afraid of the unknown.  We attempted to use a BeagleBone Black as our microcontroller, and it was a very bad decision.  It was finicky, barely worked, and needed 1-2 hours of reflash time every time it crashed.  Conventional wisdom is often that way because a lot of people have already made the same mistake you're about to.
								</li>
								<li>
									Finally, very little is more important than team dynamics and working well as a team -- except for having fun while you work, and the two often go hand in hand.  We were all willing to put in large amounts of time outside of class -- often on the weekends -- because our meetings usually had a component of fun in them.  This also helped us deal with adversity; no one ever got shirty with anyone else, even when we were all frustrated.  Working with your friends doesn't always work well, but when it does, it works <i>really</i> well.
								</li>

							The biggest realization I had as a result of this project is that systems integration is <i>difficult</i>. As a team we had each subsystem (tension control, motor control, etc.) working fairly early on in the semester. Putting them all together in a robust way took weeks. I really liked the framework we implemented on the BeagleBone Black (asynchronous and interrupt-driven), but the implementation was very difficult because of the amount of coordination so many moving parts require in a time-dependent application. I have a newfound respect for people who design and create embedded systems for a living because it is so very different than development on Linux or Windows.
						</p>
						<p>
							Another lesson I'll take into the future is that institutional support is an invaluable resource. At Olin a large portion of the student body and numerous professors have extensive experience with Arduino microcontrollers. Whenever anyone has a problem with code and/or hardware associated with an Arduino-controlled system, odds are somebody in the community knows how to help. If not, Arduino has a massive online community with numerous, well thought-out tutorials for many different applications. The BeagleBone Black is the antithesis of that. No Olin professors have done projects with it, very few students have even heard of it, and the online community is sorely lacking compared to the Arduino. I love what the BBB brings to the table in terms of its OS and support for Node, but when it didn't work as expected or crashed there were few resources available to help us resolve the issues. A lot of time was spent debugging things that would have been easily done in a different programming environment. Following the path well-traveled is a wise decision when attempting to do an ambitious project in a short time span.
						</p>
						<p>
							The software developement process was motivated by agile principles learned at my internship last summer. I made tests for every new piece of functionality and frequently refactored code. I was careful to decouple the functionality of various objects, as well. For instance, a Servo object's sole responsibility was to take an 'angle' paramter and turn the servo to that angle. On the surface, it doesn't seem like a big deal, but if I had done this project last year I <i>know</i> that I wouldn't have given any thought to assigning the Servo object more responsibility. In that way it was a very different experience than previous coding projects that I've done. I really enjoyed the flexibility that design patterns afforded and the ease with which the code architecture took shape. This project confirmed for me that agile methodologies and design patterns are worth knowing and can streamline the software development process. 
						</p>
						<p>
							The final outcome of the project is not as spectacular as I would have wished, but I feel that our difficulties stemmed mainly from the BBB's frustrating tendency to repeatedly fail. The rest of our process allowed us to recover from the failures of the BBB - regularly scheduled deadlines for intermediate deliverables (approximately one a week) made the project feel very agile and was reflected in very positive feedback to our initial and mid-semester design reviews. The design, too, was functional, as proved by our final prototype. I wish we had realized earlier that the BBB was not going to work for us, but until the weekend before the project was due we were still hopeful about its ability to work reliably. The code we wrote for the Arduino, though functional, was rushed and not as well-designed as the framework we had on the BBB.
						</p>
						<p>
							To future POE teams, I say this. Start with an interesting problem and think carefully about how the system design will work. It is important to add functionality incrementally and to test early and often, so how can you compartmentalize the software, electrical and mechanical subsystems? I would also say that you should budget time to understand any technology with which nobody on your team has experience (multiple days to several weeks, depending on its complexity). For example, we received the BBB early in the semester but didn't start developing on it for a couple weeks because we accidentally overwrote the default operating system with a non-functional image and then had to learn about the bonescript API. Once we understood the basics we were able to prototype very rapidly, but the initial learning curve was quite steep. Last, make sure that you have intermediate goals for your project planned for the entire semester. It's okay if they change over the course of the project (I'd be surprised if they didn't), but being able to demonstrate tangible progress at the end of every week is very important to maintaining momentum.

							Development of our violin has been as full of highs and lows as the music we play. The beginning of the project was a time of excitement. Our team was seemingly perfect for the project, and our ambitions were high. We had the ideal balance of electrical, mechanical, and software expertise for the task ahead, and were each capable of being strong leaders for the rest of the team in our areas of expertise. Bouncing optimism off of optimism, we developed a vision: a project that could play music on command from the website you’re reading right now, tuning its strings with the press of a button, and playing simultaneous melodies and harmonies for a number of songs. We imagined an instrument that could be displayed confidently in the hallway that anyone could start with their smartphone. We imagined an instrument that we never created.
						</p>
						<p>
							Being fair, the final product is not far from that, and we were successful in areas we didn’t expect at the beginning. There was nothing catastrophic about our failures, and nothing shameful about the machine we created. We created a violin capable of playing any combination of strings, transitioning quickly between notes, giving position feedback, generating a tuning signal, and playing with a real horsehair bow. Yet the successes of our instrument were marred by the lack of a proper microcontroller to play its music well. We suffered the curse of the theremin, the carillon, and the 12-inch piano: wonderful contraptions lacking skilled players to bring out their true potential. 
						</p>
						<p>
							The result of our endeavor was an unexpected lesson-filled fable on how to fall short of your goals while succeeding the whole way through. One of the most critical lessons learned is the importance of having a fully working system as soon as possible. We were heavily focused on the mechanical system from the start, and for good reasons. We had heard countless stories of POE teams sketchily fixing mechanical problems in the last week, and we knew that, in general, it’s easier to quickly change software than it is to change hardware. We also knew that our loftier goals were mechanical and electrical: controlling the tension of a high-load string with a cheap motor, independently moving each string into the bow, and generating a clean musical signal from a bridge made of plywood. With this in mind, we focused on rapid iteration of these problems, but we were more than halfway through the semester before we even had an operating system on our ideal microcontroller: the BeagleBone Black.
						</p>
						<p>
							We also learned that user interface is important for more than just the end users; it makes building of early prototypes much easier. This lesson was learned the hardest with our complete lack of microcontroller for the majority of the project, but also learned in subtler ways throughout. For example, our audio protoboard had audio jacks for the end user to plug in any speaker and pickup, while the H-bridge protoboards had all wires soldered directly. Not only did the solid wires break when we moved the board around while prototyping, but it was impossible to change anything about the H-Bridge board without unsoldering the wires. If we had focused on that interface by soldering on headers on and using multiwire cables, then making adjustments would have been as easy as plugging and unplugging the speaker was.
						</p>
						<p>
							Above all these, the biggest lesson gained from our project was the importance of robustness and longevity. POE projects have a tendency to try to create the perfect demo, building the project around the product. If we had flipped that on its head, and chosen the product around the project, we would have prioritized ease of maintenance, robustness, and long-term usability. The resulting goals would have been similar (replacing internet connectivity, perhaps, with a few big buttons), but the chosen microcontroller would have been the Arduino from the beginning, allowing us the time to create a system that met the rest of our goals. 
						</p>
						<p>
							The fact that our robotic violin only plays one note at a time and doesn’t tune itself might seem to be silly complaints, considering the fact that <i>we just created a robotic violin.</i> However, from these shortcomings, we’ve learned valuable lessons applicable to a huge variety of tasks in engineering. Applied correctly, these lessons can ensure the next engineering project we take on succeeds the whole way through.
